One shortfall WordPress has is that it does not send email notifications to the interested parties when any of the following occur:

A Contributor submits a post for review.
An Administrator / Editor publishes the pending post.
Rest easy, this simple plugin solves this issue.

What are the benefits of having this simple plugin:

1. Ensure administrators / editors are immediately notified of articles pending review and take action
2. Provides efficient and timely communication to your wonderful contributors on the status of their articles.
3. Encourages them to contribute more as such actions keep your site fresh in their mind.

Simply activate the plugin and it will work auto-magically! Below is a sample of an email message from the plugin:
