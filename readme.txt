The Post Status Notifications plugin by 99 Robots provides an easy way to notify Administrators when Contributors submit posts for review or when a Contributor post is published.

== Description ==

The Post Status Notifications plugin by 99 Robots provides an easy way to notify Administrators when their Contributors submit a post for review.

Additionally, when an administrator publishes the post, the original author will be notified via email that they can see their post live on the site.

These email notifications ensure posts are not waiting for reviewers who otherwise would have to check WordPress admin manually for posts in the pending review status.

= Features =

Get a better editorial workflow by improving communication related to articles submitted for review and subsequently published by administrators.

* Email notification to Admin or Editor when a post is submitted for review
* Email notification to Contributor, All Users, Admins or Editors when a post is published on the site
* Custom Email Headers
* Custom Email Subject and Message
* Support for custom post types
* Email based on user role
* Share Links

This is great plugin for every site that accepts user submitted content, has multiple authors, or site owners running content-heavy websites. Enhance your editorial workflow with proper communication.
